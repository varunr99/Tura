# Tura
Android application for PennApps 16 which turns any Android device into a thermometer

#How it Works:
Tura uses battery capacitance readings along with a mathematical model to predict theoretical capacitance readings. 
A difference is then calculated and is then fitted to another model that maps to temperatures.
